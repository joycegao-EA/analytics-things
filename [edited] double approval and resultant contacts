-- KEY QN: When it comes to delay in refunds due to pending double approval of manual sender refund account creation, how much contacts is it bringing?

--Questions to answer here: How long do we need to wait for double approval to be given + how many contacts do we have during the process
select
    a.ACTIONTYPE,
    a.COST_CENTER_NAME,

    count(distinct b.CONTACT__KEY) AS count_contacts
from a join b on a.actionID=b.actionID
group by a.COST_CENTER_NAME, a.actiontype
order by count_contacts desc;
--conclusion, surprisingly many requests to edit refund recipients, instead of creating. Perhaps we are having issues with parsing refund details
-- No surprise APAC and Europe has the highest contacts. Both regions are known for task volume
--Handy to plot data in superset, without avg data i.e. aggregrated data
