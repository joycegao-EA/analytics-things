--Context: We were unable to process BOS BBs back in April when Shanghai went into lockdown for 2 months, as the computer for BOS to do so is in their office
--Though BOS is now able to process BBs in WFH setting, this code can still come into handy for cases when BOS is unable to process BBs for various reasons
--The catch of not being to process BBs for extended periods is that the CNY-USD FX rate may drop, resulting in Wise bearing FX losses


-- TODO: test this query against 16 June's BBs at POs 432542702, 433954663, 426410383 (cont below)
-- 395319750 (esp this there's a spreads too high warning - actl at which threshold do we get this?)
-- 426588091 (interesting cuz CB is involved)
